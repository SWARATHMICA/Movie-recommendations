# Movie-recommendations
This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python, leveraging both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The system uses a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows from Netflix. Visualizations are included to help understand the distribution of genres and the performance of recommendations.
